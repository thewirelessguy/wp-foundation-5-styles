Add Foundation 5 styles into TinyMCE, the WordPress WYSIWYG editor.

== Description ==

Add Foundation 5 styles into TinyMCE, the WordPress WYSIWYG editor.

Shortcodes are often hard for regular users as well advanced users to remember, especially if they haven’t used them in a while.

If a plugin is deactivated that makes use of a shortcode or a new theme is activated that doesn’t contain a shortcode then you will end up with shortcodes being output on the frontend of the website, e.g. [columns]. Instead with this plugin you'll just have a html element with a class that doesn’t have any styles so the browser will render it normally.

This plugin doesn't load the Zurb Foundation CSS/JavaScript files on the frontend of the website. It only loads the Foundation CSS in TinyMCE, the WordPress WYSIWYG editor. This plugin is meant to be used with a theme built with Zurb Foundation 5.


== Installation ==

Download a zip of the repository and put in a *wp-foundation-5-styles* directory inside *wp-content/plugins*.

Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in the WordPress admin.
